/**
 * Ultra-light per-NPC swing tracker.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - All calls happen on the game thread (RuneLite event bus), so no extra locking.
 * - We don't persist anything here; DbService carries history. This is just runtime cadence.
 *
 * API:
 *  - noteAttackTickAndReturnGap(now): mark an observed attack animation this tick; returns gap to previous swing, or -1.
 *  - ticksUntilNext(now, interval): how many ticks until the next expected swing based on the last observed swing.
 *  - autoAdvanceIfDue(now, interval): rolls internal phase forward if we've passed predicted swing(s).
 *  - candidateSpeed(): last observed gap (useful as a heuristic before weâ€™ve fully learned the profile).
